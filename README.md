# Employee_Attrition
Housing Market is among most volatile markets. Various parameters affect the pricing of a unit. Due to which many genuine but also bogus factors can be brought in to manipulate prices . Aim here is to predict pricing considering various genuine factors while learning and implementing statical algorithms, Machine Learning, Data Analytics using Python , Pyspark, MongoDB, Power BI and to deploy it using User interface base models in Heroku Cloud.
# ML-Notebook 
We performed different classification models to predict the employee attrition rate based on Featured selected. Random Forest Classifier achieved accuracy score of 0.9637 which is better than other Machine Learning models

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. Bagging Classifier
5. KNN Classifier
6. XGBoost Classifier
7. Voting Classifier 
8. Random Forest Classifier

#Visualization 
Data Visualization is graphical representation of information and data by using tools like charts,graphs,maps.This tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends,patterns in data. We have used PowerBI for Visualization
