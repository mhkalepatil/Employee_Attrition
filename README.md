# Employee_Attrition
Employee attrition is considered a well-known problem that needs the right decisions from the administration to preserve high qualified employee the proposed Prediction model evaluates the attrition risk for  employees in real-time owing to unavoidable variables like resignation for personal events, switching careers, lack of growth opportunities. To investigate how the company objective factors influence in attrition and what kind of working environment likely to cause attrition we have created this prediction model considering various genuine factors while learning and implementing statical algorithms, Machine Learning, Data Analytics using Python , Pyspark, MongoDB, Power BI.

# ML-Notebook 
We performed different classification models to predict the employee attrition rate based on Featured selected. Random Forest Classifier achieved accuracy score of 0.9637 which is better than other Machine Learning models.

Other classification models used:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. Bagging Classifier
5. KNN Classifier
6. XGBoost Classifier
7. Voting Classifier 
8. Random Forest Classifier

# Visualization 
Data Visualization is graphical representation of information and data by using tools like charts,graphs,maps.This tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends,patterns in data. We have used PowerBI for Visualization.
